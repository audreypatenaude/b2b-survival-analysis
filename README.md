# B2B Survival Analysis for Pipeline Forecasting

Code and data playground to better analyze pipeline data for "small-data" B2B sales pipelines.

## Overview

TBC

Folders:

* `app`: [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* `notebooks`

## Setup

### Virtual env

Setup a virtual environment with the project dependencies:

* `python -m venv venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install the dependencies needed to run the app (and, if you wish to do so, run the playground notebooks as well).


## How to run the app

* cd into the `src/app` folder
* run the main streamlit script with `streamlit run pipeline_app.py`
